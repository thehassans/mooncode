# üñºÔ∏è Logo Optimization Required

## Issue
Your `buysial2.png` logo (582KB) is causing "Out of Memory" errors during Flutter web builds.

## Solution
Optimize the logo to reduce file size:

### Recommended Specs:
- **Format**: PNG with transparency
- **Size**: 200x200 px (or 400x400 for retina displays)
- **File size**: < 50KB
- **Compression**: Use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim

### Quick Fix:
1. Go to https://tinypng.com
2. Upload `mobile_app/assets/images/buysial2.png`
3. Download optimized version
4. Replace original file
5. Rebuild app

### Expected Results:
- File size: ~20-50KB (90% reduction)
- Quality: No visible difference
- Build: No more memory errors
- Load time: Much faster

## Alternative
Use SVG format instead of PNG for even better results and scalability.
