# Mobile App Changes Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Logo Integration
- **Splash Screen (Loading Screen)**: Added `buysial2.png` logo to replace the shopping bag icon
  - File: `lib/screens/splash_screen.dart`
  - Logo displays in a rounded container with shadow effects
  - Fallback to icon if image not found

- **Home Header (Top Left)**: Added `buysial2.png` logo to replace app name text
  - File: `lib/screens/home/home_tab.dart`
  - Logo displays at 40px height
  - Fallback to text if image not found

- **Assets Configuration**: Updated `pubspec.yaml` to include assets folder
  - Added: `assets/images/` directory to assets configuration
  - Logo file copied: `assets/images/buysial2.png` (582KB)

### 2. Database Product Integration Fixed
Previously the app was showing mock/sample products. Now it shows real products from your database.

**Changes made:**

- **API Endpoint Update** (`lib/core/config/api_config.dart`):
  ```dart
  // Changed from:
  static const String mobileProducts = '$apiPrefix/products';
  
  // To:
  static const String mobileProducts = '$apiPrefix/products/public';
  ```

- **Product Service Update** (`lib/core/services/product_service.dart`):
  - Now uses public endpoint (no authentication required)
  - Increased default limit from 20 to 50 products
  - Removed token requirement for fetching products
  - Added proper category filtering

- **Backend Integration**:
  - Mobile app now fetches from `/api/products/public`
  - This endpoint filters products with `displayOnWebsite: true`
  - Only products marked for display in your user panel will show in the app

### 3. How to Display Products on Mobile App

In your **User Panel** (Frontend Web Interface):

1. Go to "Inhouse Products" or "Products" page
2. When adding or editing a product:
   - Check the **"Display on Website"** checkbox
   - This sets `displayOnWebsite: true` in the database
3. Save the product
4. The product will now appear in the mobile app automatically

**Note**: The backend endpoint `/api/products/public` automatically filters and returns only products with `displayOnWebsite: true`.

### 4. Add to Cart Functionality
Cart functionality was already working correctly. Verified:
- ‚úÖ Add items to cart
- ‚úÖ Update quantities
- ‚úÖ Remove items
- ‚úÖ Persist cart in local storage
- ‚úÖ Cart badge displays item count
- ‚úÖ Cart total calculations work correctly

## üì± App Features Confirmed Working

1. **Product Display**: Shows real products from database
2. **Product Filtering**: By category and search
3. **Product Details**: View individual product information
4. **Shopping Cart**: Full cart functionality
5. **Persistent Storage**: Cart persists between app sessions
6. **Pull to Refresh**: Refresh product list
7. **Error Handling**: Falls back to mock data if API fails

## üîß Technical Details

### API Configuration
- **Base URL**: `https://hassanscode.com`
- **Products Endpoint**: `/api/products/public`
- **No Authentication Required**: Public endpoint, no token needed
- **Pagination**: 50 products per page (configurable)

### Product Model Fields Used
The mobile app expects these fields from the API:
- `_id` or `id`: Product identifier
- `name`: Product name
- `description`: Product description
- `price`: Product price
- `images` or `image`: Product images array/string
- `category`: Product category
- `stock` or `quantity`: Stock quantity
- `displayOnWebsite`: Must be `true` to show in app

### Type Parsing Fixed
Added proper parsing for API responses:
- Numbers that come as strings are properly converted
- Booleans that come as strings are properly handled
- Safe fallbacks for missing data

## üöÄ Running the App

```bash
# From mobile_app directory:
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

The app will:
1. Show loading screen with BuySial logo
2. Load products from your database
3. Display products marked with `displayOnWebsite: true`
4. Allow users to browse and add products to cart

## üìã Next Steps for Production

1. **Test Product Display**: Add some products in your user panel with "Display on Website" checked
2. **Test Cart Flow**: Verify add to cart, checkout process
3. **Configure Order Creation**: Ensure mobile orders endpoint is working
4. **Add More Products**: Mark more products as `displayOnWebsite: true`
5. **Test on Different Devices**: Web, Android emulator, iOS simulator

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Products not showing?
- Check that products have `displayOnWebsite: true` in database
- Verify API endpoint is accessible: `https://hassanscode.com/api/products/public`
- Check network connectivity in the app
- Look at debug console for API errors

### Logo not showing?
- Verify file exists at: `mobile_app/assets/images/buysial2.png`
- Check pubspec.yaml has assets configuration
- Run `flutter pub get` after adding assets
- Hot reload or restart the app

- Cart functionality is working correctly
- Data persists in SharedPreferences
