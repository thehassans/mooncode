# 🚀 Flutter App - Run Instructions

## ✅ What You've Done So Far
1. ✅ `flutter pub get` - Downloaded all dependencies
2. ✅ Android configuration is now complete
3. ✅ Login and Register screens are ready

## 📱 Running the App

### Option 1: Run on Android Emulator (Recommended for Testing)

**1. Start Android Emulator:**
```bash
# First, check if you have an emulator
flutter emulators

# Launch an emulator (if available)
flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id>
```

**2. Run the app:**
```bash
cd c:\Users\buysialllc\Desktop\mooncode\mobile_app
flutter run
```

### Option 2: Run on Physical Android Device

**1. Enable Developer Mode on your Android phone:**
- Go to Settings → About Phone
- Tap "Build Number" 7 times
- Enable "USB Debugging" in Developer Options

**2. Connect phone via USB**

**3. Run the app:**
```bash
flutter run
```

### Option 3: Run on Chrome (Web - For Quick Testing)

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

## 🔧 If You Get Errors

### "No connected devices"
```bash
# Check connected devices
flutter devices

# If no devices, you need to either:
# 1. Connect a physical Android device via USB
# 2. Start an Android emulator
# 3. Run on Chrome: flutter run -d chrome
```

### "Android SDK not found"
You need to install Android Studio:
1. Download from: https://developer.android.com/studio
2. Run Android Studio
3. Go to Tools → SDK Manager
4. Install Android SDK
5. Run `flutter doctor` to verify

### "Gradle build failed"
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

When the app runs successfully, you should see:
1. **Splash Screen** (Blue with BuySial logo and loading indicator)
2. **Login Screen** (Email and password fields)
3. You can navigate to Register screen
4. After login, you'll see the **Home Screen** with bottom navigation

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Backend Connection
The app is configured to connect to:
```
https://hassanscode.com
```

For the app to work fully, you need to:
1. Ensure backend is running
2. Add the new API endpoints (see IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)
3. Update Product model to include `isForMobile` field

### Current Limitations
- Product images won't load yet (need actual image URLs)
- Orders won't work until backend endpoints are added
- Some screens are placeholders (Categories, Cart, Profile)

## 📊 Quick Test Without Backend

To test the UI without backend:
1. Comment out API calls in splash_screen.dart:
```dart
// await authProvider.checkAuthStatus();
```
2. Navigate directly to login:
```dart
Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (_) => const LoginScreen()),
);
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**App crashes on startup?**
- Check if backend is accessible
- Look at console logs: `flutter logs`

**Build errors?**
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

**Need to see detailed errors?**
```bash
flutter run -v  # Verbose mode
```

## 📝 Next Development Steps

Once the app runs:
1. Test login/register flows (need backend endpoints)
2. Add product images
3. Build remaining screens (product details, cart, etc.)
4. Implement checkout flow
