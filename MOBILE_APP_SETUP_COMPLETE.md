# ‚úÖ Mobile App Setup Complete!

## What Was Fixed:

Your mobile app now correctly integrates with your inhouse products through a dedicated mobile endpoint.

---

## üéØ How It Works Now:

### 1. **New Database Field**: `isForMobile`
- Added to Product model
- Separate from `displayOnWebsite` (which controls website visibility)
- You can control mobile and website products independently

### 2. **New API Endpoint**: `/api/products/mobile`
- Returns ONLY products where `isForMobile = true`
- No authentication required
- Optimized for mobile app

### 3. **Mobile App Updated**:
- Now fetches from `/api/products/mobile` instead of `/api/products/public`
- Shows only products you specifically enable for mobile

---

## üì± How to Show Products on Mobile App:

### From Your User Panel:

1. **Navigate**: User Panel ‚Üí Inhouse Products
2. **Edit Product**: Click on any product
3. **Enable Mobile**: Look for checkbox "Show on Mobile Application" or "isForMobile"
4. **Save**: Click Save/Update
5. **Done**: Product now appears in mobile app!

**Note**: If you don't see this checkbox in the frontend yet, you can still enable products via the API or database directly. The backend is ready!

---

## üîß Backend is Ready - Frontend UI Needs Update

The backend now fully supports the `isForMobile` field, but your **frontend user panel** needs a small update to show the checkbox.

### Option 1: Quick Database Update (Enable All Products for Mobile)

If you want ALL your existing products to show in the mobile app right now:

```javascript
// Run in MongoDB
db.products.updateMany(
  { stockQty: { $gt: 0 } }, // Only products with stock
  { $set: { isForMobile: true } }
)
```

### Option 2: Enable Specific Products via API

You can manually enable products using the API:

```bash
# Update a specific product to show on mobile
curl -X PATCH https://hassanscode.com/api/products/PRODUCT_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"isForMobile": true}'
```

### Option 3: Wait for Frontend Update

Someone can add a checkbox to your frontend product edit form labeled "Show on Mobile Application" that sends `isForMobile: true/false` when saving.

---

## üß™ Testing the Setup:

### Test 1: Check Backend Endpoint
```bash
curl https://hassanscode.com/api/products/mobile
```
Should return `{"products": [], "pagination": {...}}` (empty if no products enabled yet)

### Test 2: Enable a Product
```bash
# Replace PRODUCT_ID and TOKEN
curl -X PATCH https://hassanscode.com/api/products/PRODUCT_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"isForMobile": true}'
```

### Test 3: Check Endpoint Again
```bash
curl https://hassanscode.com/api/products/mobile
```
Should now return the enabled product!

### Test 4: Check Mobile App
- Run the mobile app
- Product should appear in the list

---

## üìã Files Changed:

### Backend:
1. `/backend/src/modules/models/Product.js` - Added `isForMobile` field
2. `/backend/src/modules/routes/products.js`:
   - Added field handling in POST (create)
   - Added field handling in PATCH (update)
   - Added new GET `/mobile` endpoint

### Mobile App:
1. `/mobile_app/lib/core/config/api_config.dart` - Changed endpoint to `/api/products/mobile`

---

## üéØ Next Steps:

### Immediate (To See Products in Mobile App):

**Option A - Enable All Products** (Recommended for testing):
```javascript
// MongoDB command
db.products.updateMany({}, { $set: { isForMobile: true } })
```

**Option B - Enable Select Products via API**:
Use the PATCH endpoint mentioned above for each product

### Future (For Better UX):

**Add Checkbox to Frontend Product Form**:
Someone should add a checkbox in your frontend product edit page:
```html
<input 
  type="checkbox" 
  name="isForMobile" 
  checked={product.isForMobile}
  onChange={handleChange}
/>
<label>Show on Mobile Application</label>
```

---

## üîç Troubleshooting:

### Mobile App Shows No Products?
1. **Check Backend**: Visit https://hassanscode.com/api/products/mobile
2. **If Empty**: No products have `isForMobile: true` yet
3. **Solution**: Enable products using one of the methods above

### How to Check if a Product is Enabled?
```bash
curl https://hassanscode.com/api/products/PRODUCT_ID
```
Look for `"isForMobile": true` in the response

### Backend Needs Restart?
If you just made these changes, restart your backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm start
# or
pm2 restart all
```
